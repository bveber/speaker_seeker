1
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:34,402
Now to our own pie in the sky--
Bill Pie in the KBBL trafficcopter.

2
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:35,544
- So come in, Bill.

3
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:36,746
- Bad news, drivers.

4
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:38,259
There's an overturned melon truck

5
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:39,915
on the interstate. Oh, it's a mess.

6
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,126
There's lots of rubber neck in gandmelon
wrestling going on, so expect delays--

7
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:46,923
- Hey, doughnuts!
- Bart, there's one left, and it's mine.

8
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:53,555
Oh!

9
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,139
- Aw, Homer!
- Aw, Dad!

10
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:57,934
- Uh-oh, schoolbus!

11
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,352
Cool your jets, man. We're comin'.

12
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:02,647
You forgot the special lunches I made.

13
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,149
- That's okay, Mom!
- We got money!

14
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:08,528
- Now, just a darn--
- Aah!

15
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,738
Mmm.

16
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,244
Oh.

17
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:20,539
- This is Bill Pie, your pie
in the sky, saying good-bye.

18
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:24,252
Well, Maggie,
it's just you and me again.

19
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:30,425
This is KBBL,
K-Babble, all talk, 24 hours a day.

20
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,344
If you'd like to share your
embarrassing problem with our audience,

21
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,723
we invite you to call our therapist
of the airwaves, Dr. Marvin Monroe.

22
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:41,019
Our number is 555-PAI N.

23
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,521
Don't be afraid. Call now.

24
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:51,446
- Hello.
I'd like to talk to Dr. Monroe.

25
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:55,950
I'm Marge, 34,
and my problem is my husband.

26
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:59,120
He doesn't listen to me.
He doesn't appreciate me.

27
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,247
I don't know how much more
of this I can--

28
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,042
Save your whining for when
you're on the air, okay?

29
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,632
Okay, let's see.
Next we have Marge.

30
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,635
She's 34 and trapped in
a loveless sham of a marriage.

31
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:17,055
Hey, turn it up.
I love hearing those wackos.

32
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:20,433
- Tell me 'bout your husband, Marge.
- Well--

33
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,228
When we were dating,
he was sweeter...

34
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:26,021
and more romantic and 40 pounds thinner,

35
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:28,941
and he had hair,
and he ate with utensils.

36
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:34,446
-What was that last thing you said? Ah.

37
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,448
Isn't that your wife, Homer?

38
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,452
Don't be ridiculous.
My wife worships the ground I walk on.

39
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:44,122
Marge,
it's what I call "harsh reality time."

40
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:46,332
Your husband sees you as nothing.

41
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:50,629
- Oh. Okay. Well, thank you.
- No, no, no, don't hang up.

42
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:53,131
The pig has made you
into his mother.

43
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:56,344
You are not the hot love object
you deserve to be.

44
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:59,720
- Really?
- I'm as sure of it as I'm sure

45
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,849
Tonight, the second
he comes through that front door,

46
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:07,521
you've got to tell him you're fed up,
and if he doesn't start loving,

47
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,648
Leave Homer?

48
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:11,733
- Don't use his real name!
- Leave Pedro?

49
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:16,446
- Can you be that honest?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:19,533
- You'll tell him right when
he comes home from work.

51
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:22,952
- Say it likeyou mean it.
- Yeah!

52
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:25,247
- Attagirl.

53
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,332
Come on, Bart. Not again.

54
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,627
- Where's your sense of humor?

55
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:33,046
- Moe's Tavern.
- Hello. Is Al there?

56
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,549
- Al?
- Yeah, Al. Last name, Coholic.

57
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:37,551
Lemme check.

58
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:40,554
Phone call for Al, Al Coholic!

59
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:44,515
- Is there an Al Coholic here?

60
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:50,354
Wait a minute. Listen,
you little yellow-bellied rat jackass.

61
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:52,815
If I ever find out who you are,
I'll kill ya!

62
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,948
I hope you do find
that punk someday, Moe. Fill 'er up.

63
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,119
Is eveything okay?
Usually you have a quick one,

64
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:07,038
some peanuts, beefjerky,
pickled eggs, and you're outta here.

65
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,125
Let's just say I don't feel
like goin' home tonight. Jar, please.

66
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,421
Hey, you can level with me.

67
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:17,715
- You got a domestic situation?
- You might say that.

68
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,718
My wife's gonna leave me
'cause she thinks I'm a pig.

69
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:22,720
- Homer.
- What?

70
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:26,349
- Marge is right. You are a pig.
You can ask anyone in this bar.

71
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:28,726
Hey, Barney, am I a pig?

72
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:33,023
You're no more of a pig than I am.

73
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:36,317
- Oh, no!
- See? You're a pig.

74
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:40,030
Barney's a pig. Lary's a pig.
We're all pigs.

75
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:42,823
Except for one difference.

76
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,619
Once in a while,
we can crawl out of the slop,

77
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,747
hose ourselves off
and act like human beings.

78
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,918
Homer, buy your wife some flowers and
take her out for a night on the town.

79
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:55,921
Candles, table cloth,
the whole nine yards.

80
00:05:55,921 --> 00:06:00,216
Gee, a romantic evening.
Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.

81
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:02,343
I'm not done. After dinner,

82
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:06,223
the two of you are going to check
into the fanciest motel in town...

83
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:11,520
and not check out until
the next morning, if you get my drift.

84
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:14,731
I read you loud and clear.
Heh, heh, heh, heh!

85
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:17,525
- Wow, a quarter past 6:00.

86
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,155
- What's keeping Dad?
- Yeah, who'd possibly be late

87
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:27,327
Uh, I'd like some flowers.

88
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:31,038
- What kind of flowers?
- You know, pretty ones, not dead.

89
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,624
We have some beautiful
long-stem roses.

90
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:37,044
- They're $55 a dozen.
- One, please.

91
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:52,853
- Hey, Mom.
- How 'bout some grub?

92
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:55,354
- Aaah!

93
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,335
Your
husband sees you as nothing, as nothing.

94
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:20,254
The pig has made you
into his mother, his mother.

95
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:23,424
You are not the hot love object
you deserve to be,

96
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:25,426
deserve to be,
deserve to be.

97
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:29,723
If he doesn't start loving, leave him,
leave him, leave him, leave him.

98
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,944
Marge, I, uh--
love you.

99
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,947
No, that's not good.

100
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,950
Marge, honey, I love you.

101
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,952
Oh. Um--

102
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:53,955
Marge, I love ya, baby.

103
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,832
Marge, sweetie,"hooney," honey--

104
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,627
Ah, this'll never work.

105
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:11,556
- I love you, Marjorie.
- Oh, Homer.

106
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,517
I love you too.

107
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:16,520
Mmmwha!

108
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:19,146
- A little predinner entertainment.

109
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,942
- Moe's Tavern.
- Is Oliver there?

110
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,236
- Who?
- Oliver Klozoff.

111
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,530
Hold on. I'll check. Oliver Klozoff!

112
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,950
- Call for Oliver Klozoff!

113
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:35,830
And I made reservations
at the Chez Paree.

114
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:39,041
But, Homer, it's so expensive.

115
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,420
It matters not, mon frere.
And after desserts,

116
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:44,423
we'll adjourn to our second-floor room
at the Offramp Inn.

117
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,632
Oh, Homer!
I feel giddy!

118
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:48,926
Wait. What about a baby-sitter?

119
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:50,929
- Oops.
- Not to wory.

120
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,058
Listen, ya lousy bum.
If I ever get a hold of you,

121
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,644
Goodness. Must be a crossed wire.

122
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:03,859
- Rubber Baby Buggy
Bumper Baby-sitting Service.

123
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,319
- I'd like a baby-sitter for the evening.
- Wait a minute.

124
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:08,322
The Simpsons.

125
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,325
Lady, you've gotta be kidding!

126
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:16,747
- Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper
Baby-sitting Service.

127
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,249
Hello. This is Mr. S-Sampson.

128
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,752
Did your wife just call a second ago?

129
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:24,421
- No, I said Sampson, not Simpson.
- Thank God!

130
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:28,049
Those Simpsons,
what a bunch of savages!

131
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,053
- Especially that big-ape father.
- Doh!

132
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,847
Actually, the Simpsons
are neighbors of ours,

133
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:38,519
and we've found them to be a quite
misunderstood and underrated family.

134
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,437
Mom, you look so glamorous.

135
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:45,025
Well, tonight is a vey special night.

136
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,153
Your father is taking me out
for dinner and dancing.

137
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:50,447
- Dad dances?
- Like an angel.

138
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,241
Ba, ba

139
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,244
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
ba-ba, ba, ba

140
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,955
Ba, ba, ba, ba-ba

141
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:01,959
- Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba
ba, ba, ba-ba

142
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,546
- You know, one day you'll learn
to move like your old man.

143
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,424
Son, there's not a woman alive...

144
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:12,135
who can resist a man
who knows how to mambo.

145
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:15,347
- You don't have a clue, do you, Dad?
- Out, boy.

146
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:18,642
- Out!
- What a grump.

147
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:24,022
Hm. Hm.

148
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,859
Hmm! Hm, hm.

149
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:30,028
Hmm? Hee.

150
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:32,655
Smooth as a baby's behind!

151
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:36,158
Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba

152
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:39,246
- Precious, I think I hear the doorbell.

153
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:42,249
I think you're right, dumplin'.
Bart! Get the door!

154
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:44,334
Aye, aye, mambo man.

155
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:48,129
Oof!

156
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:55,345
- Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
ba-ba, ba, ba

157
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,431
- Yes. I am Miss Botz.
- Just don't stand there, boy.

158
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:02,853
- Help Miss Botz with her suitcases.
- I can handle my own luggage.

159
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:05,439
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

160
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:08,233
Here are the phone numbers of
the restaurant where we'll be dining...

161
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,444
and the motel where we'll
be spending the night.

162
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:14,739
You'll have to put Maggie to bed now,
but Bart and Lisa can stay up

163
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:17,533
Until then, they can watch
a tape from our video libray.

164
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:21,121
Oh, boy! The Happy Little Elves
Meet the Curious Bear Cub.

165
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:23,832
Oh, the Elves! The Elves!

166
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:26,752
- Bye, kids! Watch out for the boy.

167
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,631
Mmmwha! Bye, now.
Mmmwha! Be good.

168
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,424
- Mmmwha! Gotta go.
- Ba, ba

169
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:36,053
Ba, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba
ba-ba, ba, ba

170
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:39,431
Come, children.
Let's go watch The Happy Little Elves.

171
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:42,642
We've seen The Crappy Little Elves
about 14 billion times.

172
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:45,937
- Maybe we can watch some real TV.
- We're gonna watch the tape.

173
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,941
Aw! That's merely suggested
viewing matter, lady.

174
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:51,150
Mom lets us watch
whatever the hell we want.

175
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,653
I said you're gonna watch this tape.

176
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:56,822
And you're gonna do what I say,
or I'm gonna do something to you.

177
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,827
And I don't know what that is, because
everybody has always done what I say.

178
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,420
They all look so tasty,

179
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:13,423
but I think I'll eat
this one right there.

180
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,635
- Why don't you pick one
that's a little more frisky, sir.

181
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:20,556
Well, when you choose one
that's floating upside down,

182
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:24,559
it somewhat defeats the purpose
ofselecting a live lobster.

183
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:29,356
Oh, okay. Then I'll take
that one there with the beady eyes.

184
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:32,942
Excellent choice, sir.
May I lead you to your table?

185
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:35,319
Oui, oui. After you.

186
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:38,030
And I'll be seeing you later.

187
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,952
Help! Help!

188
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:45,955
Faster, faster!
We gotta save Bubbles.

189
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:49,126
Oh, man, I can't take it anymore.

190
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:52,546
- But I want to see what happens!
- You know what happens.

191
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,548
They find Captain Kook's treasure.

192
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:57,551
All the elves dance around
like idiots. I puke. The end.

193
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:01,345
Bart, you're just like Chilly,
the elf who cannot love.

194
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,723
- Now for some real TV.

195
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:06,726
All right!
America's Most Armed and Dangerous.

196
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:09,145
Oh, no! Bart!
We'll have nightmares!

197
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:11,648
Relax. This is cinema verite.

198
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:15,027
When the brutal, slow-motion killing
starts, I'll tell you to shut your eyes.

199
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:19,447
The Cue Ball Killer should be considered
extremely armed and dangerous.

200
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,535
if you think you've seen him,
call 1 -800-U-SQUEAL.

201
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,038
Homer, you look just like a little boy.

202
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:30,124
- 'Cause I'm so care free?
- No, because you're wearing a bib.

203
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:38,049
- More champagne?
- Mmm.

204
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,135
Whoops. Time for a fill-up.

205
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,223
Garcon! Another bottle of
your second-least-expensive champagne.

206
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:47,142
The defenseless youngsters were tied up
and gagged in the living room...

207
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,645
while the bandit roamed
through the house at will,

208
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,148
stealing the valuable objects it took
the family a lifetime to shop for.

209
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:15,837
You know, Marge,
this is just like when we were dating.

210
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,757
Except for one thing--
no chaperone.

211
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,760
Ho, ho, hoo!

212
00:14:21,843 --> 00:14:25,347
The Baby-sitter Bandit has left a trail
ofher daring nighttime robberies...

213
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,431
across the continental
United States.

214
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:29,434
She could be lurking anywhere,

215
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,228
about to descend upon another house
full of unsuspecting dupes.

216
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:34,231
- Eee!
- Wow!

217
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:37,525
In a moment, we will show you a picture
of the real Baby-sitter Bandit,

218
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,236
Miss Lucille Botzcowski.

219
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,947
- Remember, she may be using
a clever alias...

220
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:48,452
and should be considered
armed and dangerous!

221
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:50,955
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

222
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:55,335
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

223
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:07,723
Run for it!

224
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,147
1 -800-U-SNITCH. No, U-SQUEAL.

225
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,150
- Oh, no!

226
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:23,155
Don't forget to tell me
when you see the Offramp.

227
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,657
Oh, thereit--

228
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:28,035
went.

229
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:32,038
No problemo.
We'll just get off at the next exit.

230
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,843
Bart.

231
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:47,637
Bart.

232
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:51,225
Bart. Bart.

233
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:53,351
Hmm.

234
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:56,355
Time to brush your teeth,
wash your face...

235
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,856
and say your prayers.

236
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:02,653
Are you in... here?

237
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:05,155
Oh! Homemade pickled beets.

238
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,535
Go ahead. Take 'em all.

239
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:17,458
Seeing as no one was hurt, I think it
would be really silly to dwell on this.

240
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,962
- Come on! Come on!

241
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,921
- Finally!

242
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,923
Hello, vigilant viewer.

243
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,843
You have reached
America's Most Armed and Dangerous.

244
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:31,223
I'm calling to report the Baby-sitter
Bandit! She's in our house right--

245
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:34,851
Come on, Marge.
Let me carry you over the threshold.

246
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:38,229
Okay, but watch out.
Don't slam my head like last time.

247
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:41,233
Sheesh! Eleven years ago,
and you've never forgotten it!

248
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:44,527
- Don't muss my hair!
- Ohh! Oh! Oh!

249
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:46,363
Yi! Oh! Yeow!

250
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:47,239
Yi! Oh! Yeow!

251
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:49,532
- Whee! This is fun!

252
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,161
We know who you are, Miss Botz.

253
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:56,038
Or should I say Miss Botzcowski?

254
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:59,333
- You're the Baby-sitter Bandit.
- You're a smart, young man, Bart.

255
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,546
- I hope you're smart enough
to keep your mouth shut.

256
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:07,426
You're crazy if you think you're gonna
get awaywith this. You can't--

257
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,761
I'm really not a bad person.
Here. While I finish up,

258
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,723
you guys can watch the rest
of your favorite videocassette.

259
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:19,145
Quiet, Bart!
Let's make the best of this.

260
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:24,650
Maybe I'll go slip into something
a little more comfortable.

261
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:28,655
Oh! Your blue thing with the things?

262
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:32,033
- You'll see.
- Well, shake a leg, mama.

263
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,131
Kidstuff!

264
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,134
Hardly worth it.

265
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,135
Lottajunk.

266
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,639
Soileds.

267
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:55,431
Stupid Sampsons.

268
00:18:07,944 --> 00:18:10,030
- Maggie! Maggie!

269
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,324
Come here!

270
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:17,662
- Good-bye!
- Good-bye, eveybody!

271
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:19,830
- Bye!
- Yea!

272
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:21,832
Maggie,

273
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,962
wanna watch
The Happy Little Elves again?

274
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:29,757
Okay, but you have
to untie me first.

275
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,054
Oh, Homer!

276
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,434
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

277
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:45,356
- Oh, so you got out of your crib.

278
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:48,442
I guess you need
to be tied up too.

279
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,157
- Maggie, where are you?

280
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:58,161
- Maggie! Maggie!

281
00:18:58,244 --> 00:19:00,329
- Heh, heh, heh.

282
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:21,642
Homer, would it spoil the mood
if I called home,

283
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:24,437
you know, just to check on the kids?

284
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:37,325
Homer, wake up!
There's no answer at home.

285
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,745
- So?
- So I'm worried.

286
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,747
All right.

287
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:45,458
I suppose my work here is done.
Heh, heh, heh, heh!

288
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,462
Hello, vigilant viewer.
How may we help you?

289
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:53,049
We caught her!
We caught the Baby-sitter Bandit!

290
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:56,052
- Ask if there's a reward.
- Is there a reward?

291
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:59,347
- If she's convicted, we get T-shirts!
- Yeah!

292
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:02,850
- How come all the lights are on?
- I don't like the looks of this.

293
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:05,937
- Miss Botz!

294
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:07,939
- Good Lord!

295
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:10,942
What have those little
hellions done now?

296
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:13,528
We're so sorry.
We're so sorry!

297
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:16,739
Please turn off the TV.

298
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:20,327
I can't tell you how chagrined we are
about all of this.

299
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,037
Oh, these things are heavy.

300
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,250
Just so there's no hard feelings,
here's double your pay.

301
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,252
- No, no, triple.
- Thank you.

302
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:32,463
- Mr. Sampson,
can I give you a bit of advice?

303
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:35,759
- Don't turn your back
on that boy for a second.

304
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:38,761
Ain't that the truth?
You know, one time he--

305
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:41,765
- Huh?

306
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:46,853
This way to the scene of the crime,
men! I got her tied up in the den.

307
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,855
Just a minute, young man!

308
00:20:48,938 --> 00:20:52,025
I don't know what kind of shenanigans
you've been pulling this time,

309
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:55,444
but I just had to untie your baby-sitter
and pay her off so that--

310
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:59,031
Excuse me. Are you saying to the world
that you just aided and abetted...

311
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:02,243
the escape of the notorious
Baby-sitter Bandit?

312
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,454
- The what?
- The Baby-sitter Bandit.

313
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:09,041
Oh, uh, a-are you sure
this microphone works?

314
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,629
Uh, well, I wouldn't say I aided her.
This is on, right?

315
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:15,131
Because actually
it was quite a struggle.

316
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:17,759
Oh, Homer!

317
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,344
Have you ever seen a kung fu movie?
It was just like that.

318
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:23,640
But now I know her moves.
So, if you're listening to me, lady,

319
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,144
you'd better think long and hard
before tying something like this

320
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:34,025
- Lord, help me.
I'm just not that bright.

321
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:37,446
Oh, Homer, don't say that.

322
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:40,239
The way I see it,
if you raise three children...

323
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:44,243
who can knock out
and hogtie a perfect stranger,

324
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:46,829
Yeah.

325
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:50,249
Yeah!

326
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:52,835
Mmmmwha!

327
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,254
Honey, can we make up again?

328
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:57,256
Oh, my goodness!

329
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,264
- Shh!
9999
